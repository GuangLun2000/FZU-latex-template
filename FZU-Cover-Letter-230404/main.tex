% The material below is a whole big dang thing whose purpose is just to set up a fixed coordinate system for \tikz so that you can put the Department or School address in the upper right-hand side without it moving all around every time you change something in the page.  I think it works.
% Defining a new coordinate system for the page:
%
% --------------------------
% |(-1,1)    (0,1)    (1,1)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,0)    (0,0)    (1,0)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,-1)   (0,-1)  (1,-1)|
% --------------------------

\def\parsecomma#1,#2\endparsecomma{\def\page@x{#1}\def\page@y{#2}}

	\parsecomma#1\endparsecomma
	\pgfpointanchor{current page}{north east}
	% Save the upper right corner
	\pgf@xc=\pgf@x%

% One can add a signature image in a PDF file using the following code; this requires a file called "signature.pdf" to be installed in the same folder as the .tex file.  The vertical spacing (\vspace) and the scaling will have to be adjusted to get things to look correct for your particular signature image. Alternatively, comment out the following line in favor of the one labeled "[[Alternate]]" if you want to sign a paper copy of the letter.
%
\signature{
	\vspace{-12mm}\includegraphics[width=18em]{signature.pdf}\\\vspace{-2mm}

% If you want a date different from the current date, comment out the next line in favor of the line labeled "[[Alternate]]".  The ``\vspace{10mm}'' just moves the date down a tiny bit so it doesn't interfere with the header.  This can be adjusted to your preference.

		% This line sets up the return address to the right-side of the FZU logo.  The location is set with absolute node addresses using ``\tikz''.
